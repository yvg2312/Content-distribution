To run our project on deter lab:

1. Install the dependencies (on every node):
- Casablanca
- Boost
- Crypto++ (if encryption desired)

On deterlab, we were able to do this by manually installing Casablanca as the website describes, by first installing (in Ubuntu) the packages:

libboost-random1.54-dev
libboost-chrono1.54-dev
libboost-system1.54-dev
libboost-thread1.54-dev
libboost-locale1.54-dev
libboost-regex1.54-dev
libboost-filesystem1.54-dev
g++-4.8
g++
git
make
libssl-dev
cmake
git

Then you can download casablanca by running:
git clone http://git01.codeplex.com/casablanca

And then build it by running:
cd casablanca/Release
mkdir build.release
cd build.release
CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make

Note: we chose to have the Casablanca built in the home directory, and so our makefiles will be based on that.

2. Download and build our code (on every node):
Download it from Github (branch Integration)

git clone -b Integration https://github.com/ydj0604/Content-Distribution-Network 

Then build
cd Content-Distribution-Network/
make

The Makefile will build all executables to build/ if the dependencies are set up correctly.

Note: even after building the project you MUST export the binaries for Casablanca as part of your LD_LIBRARY_FLAGS or the project will not be dynamically linked when you run the executables. This must be done on every node.


3. Run each of the executables on the desired nodes (in this order):
These addresses must specify ports, and must be distinct

./meta [meta address] [origin address]
./fss [fss address] [meta address] 
./cdn [cdn address] [meta address] [fss address]
./client [--download,--upload,--sync] [directory] [meta address]
